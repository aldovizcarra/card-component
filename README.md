## My process

First I created the html markup. It took me a couple of trys to finally get a markup that worked. I then used css flexbox to style the markup.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project I have learned how to create better markup. I also learned how use css flexbox.


### Continued development

I want to continue learning css flexbox and other aspects of css, like css grid and bootstrap.
